In 2024, I decided to study AI in a more practical way, because thanks to my college, 
I was aware that most AI models so far are highly empirical in solving problems, 
after taking a practice-oriented AI course back in 2019.
Getting certified with NVIDIA became my systematic practice to learn GenAI.
Why NVIDIA? They seem to best know what is the most important thing to do in the era of AI,
and therefore they invented GPU and CUDA. Let's look at the certification now.

NVIDIA-Certified Associate: Generative AI and LLMs (NCA-GENL) Exam/Certificate.
Why this certificate? GenAI with LLM is the trend now and I am a software engineer. 

It has the following benefits:
1. A certificate to demonstrate GenAI learning results, to some extent at least.
2. A clear learning path has been provided by the exam guide.
3. NVIDIA provides generous GPU usage and frustration-free Jupyter Notebook environment.

Time I spent: 60 hrs = 50 hrs (taking the courses) + 10 hrs (exam prep)



I had taken the following courses before the exam, and I am sure I overstudied in terms of the exam itself:
1. Generative AI Explained https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-FX-07+V1/
2. Getting Started with Deep Learning
3. Augment your LLM Using Retrieval Augmented Generation
4. Introduction to Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing
5. Building LLM Applications With Prompt Engineering
6. Building RAG Agents with LLMs
7. Rapid Application Development with Large Language Models (LLMs)
