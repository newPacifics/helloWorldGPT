## Why am I building this website?

1. I need somewhere to blog-blog. A growth record for myself.
2. I have not done so because it involves too many boiler-plate code, complicated UI/UX work if I want to make it look nice, or no-code website == no fun.
3. Now, we've got Cursor. I want to know how much I can delegate work to the agent. I want to know how this new paradigm would re-shape work labor composition in the industry.

## The not-so-technical things I have learned so far:

1. I am finally going to be a product maker, if not today, one day! Who knows the software systems better than a software engineer? Who can bridge that gap between product and engineering? A great software engineer who does not want to code the non-critical details and wants to hear the customers!
2. During this website building, I really spent most of my time thinking and working on these.
    1. What features am I going to make?
    2. What are the priorities of the feature?
    3. How do I architecture the system well enough to deliver the core features fast and still open it up for more features later?
    4. What are all my options in picking up a design, a framework, or a library? How might it end up amending the features we are making?
    5. How fast can this product iteration go?
3. It actually forces you to do so. Why? It generates code so fast that you will get lost easily
if you do not maneuver it with vision.
