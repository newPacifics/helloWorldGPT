In 2024, I decided to study AI in a more *practical* way, because thanks to my college, 
I was aware that AI models are by nature highly empirical in solving problems, 
after taking a coding-centered AI course back in 2019.

Since then, it became quite hard for me to navigate through AI knowledge. There are so much 
of them and most are academic. 
Finally, I realized I need a practical goal to grasp some hands-on experience in this 
huge boom of AI industry. Why NVIDIA? They initiated this boom.

### Goal: Pass NVIDIA-Certified Associate: Generative AI and LLMs (NCA-GENL) Exam.

It has the following benefits:
1. A certificate to demonstrate GenAI learning results, to some degree at least.
2. An industry-approved learning path has been provided by the exam guide.
3. NVIDIA offers generous GPU usage and pre-set lab environment.

### Plan

#### Time I spent: 53 hrs = 50 hrs (online courses and reading) + 3 hrs (exam prep)

#### Courses (I definitely over-studied. The highlighted ones are recommended by the exam study guide):
1. *Generative AI Explained* https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-FX-07+V1/
2. *Getting Started with Deep Learning*
3. Augment your LLM Using Retrieval Augmented Generation
4. *Introduction to Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing*
5. Building LLM Applications With Prompt Engineering
6. Building RAG Agents with LLMs
7. *Rapid Application Development with Large Language Models (LLMs)*

#### Key concepts:
1. The basic AI/ML concepts that every course should cover in five hours, such as CNN, LSTM, 
ReLU, gradient, k-fold, k-means etc.
2. The NVIDIA tools: GPU parallel computing, NeMo, Triton, RAPIDS, Nvivida GPU Cloud, 
Trustworthy AI principles etc.
3. LLM specific knowledge: attention, BERT, LLM model performance metrics (perplexity),
diffusion model, RAG, LoRA, NLP scores.

#### Verification: how do we know we learned stuff?
1. Well, passing the exam gives you certificate.
2. I start to build this LLM product -- ConVerge. And I find the knowledge being useful.
